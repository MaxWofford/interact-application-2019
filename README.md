## What did you create in 2018 that you’re the most proud of? Do you have any major projects or initiatives in mind for 2019?

I'm most proud of my work with [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com/) (https://hackclub.com), a nonprofit network of high school computer science clubs, as our operations lead this past year. As operations lead, I manage onboarding new clubs, growing our community, and ensuring that our leaders have the support they need to succeed.

In 2018, my work was directly responsible for Hack Club growing from 220 to over 300 schools and our Slack community growing from 367K annual messages in 2017 to 1.8M+ in 2018 (5x increase).

I built [hackathons.hackclub.com](http://hackathons.hackclub.com/) in 2 days, which is now the most popular high school hackathon directory worldwide. At launch, it front-paged Product Hunt & since then has gotten email subscribers in 200+ cities across 30+ countries. It’s been up for only 8 months, and is now the first result for almost any query around high school hackathons.

The achievement I'm most proud of in 2018 is launching Hack Club Bank (https://hackclub.com/bank). In less than a month, I led a team of three to launch the first nonprofit fiscal sponsorship platform for students under the age of 18. Our launch post on Hacker News was the most popular post of the day, reaching 20K uniques, and the product has since done over $200,000 in transactions over the past 6 months. We've signed on 40 events during our invite-only beta, already enabling hackathons with over 1,000 unique attendees.

In 2019 I hope to increase my capacity to work on meaningful goals by getting more people involved in the projects I work on. It's one thing to build my own projects that have impact on people, it's another to build a team of people working on larger projects than I could take on myself. The only way for Hack Club to become a household name is to grow it faster than I can do alone.

## Tell us about three core interests you have. Why do you care about these things?


1. Building meaningful things. Life is too short and I want to leave a mark.
2. Reflection and better introspection. I can't effectively execute if I'm working on the wrong things. I want to be in control of my own destiny.
3. Expanding my worldview through talking with interesting people. We live in a large world with increasingly varied experiences. I've only experienced a small slice of the human experience and I know how easy it is to get trapped in echo chambers. Also, great people make life fun!

## In what ways are you looking to grow personally?

I want to maximize impact in my life and I’ve reached a point at Hack Club where hopping on mentorship calls with high schoolers or staying up late nights to bash out code is starting to give diminishing returns.

I can complete goals by myself, but what I need to increase capacity beyond myself to accomplish more challenging and meaningful goals. If my goals was to become an effective executor in 2018, my goal in 2019 is to learn to lead. I believe that I can have a far higher impact by building leadership as a core competency.

## What do people not find out about you until they’ve known you for a while?

Growing up, some people had dogs, some people had cats, but I had emus, a king vulture, and a crow missing a wing. Oh, and did I mention I’m from Los Angeles?

My mom would walk through our suburban streets with an emu on a leash.

Now she has a king vulture, the oldest living in captivity, named Gus. It was even flown first class to appear on the TODAY Show in New York in October 2018.

## Why are you interested in becoming an Interact Fellow?

I taught myself to code in high school by going to hackathons–surrounding myself with hundreds of people smarter than me. I loved the experience and am the programmer I am today because I was able to find the right environment.

In the following 4 years, I’ve reached a point where I feel like I can build anything I set my mind to with code, but I still don’t have the capacity to do all that I want to be doing. I'm starting to realize that to maximize my impact, I need to learn to move others to action.

I think the best way to do that will be just like how I learned to code: surrounding myself with smart people who embody the qualities I hope to. I want to become an Interact Fellow to find those people.

## Who (between 18 and 23) would you be the most excited to find out was in your Fellowship class? Why?

I don’t know. It hurts to say those words because I don’t want to look aimless or dumb, but after googling things like “18-23 year old leaders”, I think it’s the only honest answer.

Instead of going to college for CS, I traveled to Costa Rica and lived with a group of digital nomads for 3 months to see what “being a programmer” really meant.

Going in I had almost no expectation for who I’d be meeting, but looking back it was probably the most formative period of my life.

I don’t know who I’d meet in Interact, but I do know that I’ll make the most of it if I have the opportunity.

## How did you learn about Interact?

I work with Zach Latta at Hack Club and he's said a million good things about Interact. He also recommended applying.
